= Step-Object: src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file

Represents a Step-Object file called Input file.feature.
It should be Input file.asciidoc which I'll rename later.
The Input file is a file processed by the daily batchjob.

I think this only handles one parameter at a time so two rows would be needed to specify two parameters for the same step definition.
