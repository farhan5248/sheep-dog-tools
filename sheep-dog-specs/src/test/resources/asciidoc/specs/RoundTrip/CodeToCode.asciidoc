== Test-Setup: Create a feature file

The formatting of the data and example tables is intentionally different to make sure that the file is regenerated

=== Given: The code-prj project, src-gen/test/resources/cucumber/specs/Process.feature file is created as follows

----
@tag2 @tag3
Feature: Process

  Background: Setup

    Given The blah application, something/Object page is created as follows
          \"\"\"
          Text 1
          
          Text 2
          \"\"\"

  @tag1
  Scenario: Submit One

    Basic EDI claim

     When The blah application, something/Object page is empty
     Then The blah application, something/Object page is empty
      And The blah application, something/Object page is empty

  Scenario Outline: Submit Several

    Given The blah application, DataTable page is created as follows
          |   h1 |   h2 |
          | <h3> | <h4> |

    Examples: Data Set

          |  h3 |  h4 |
          | v31 | v41 |

=== When: The maven plugin, cucumber-to-uml goal is executed with

| Tags
| tag1

=== And: The maven plugin, uml-to-cucumber goal is executed with

|===
| Tags
| tag1

== Test-Case: Feature file is preserved

=== Then: The code-prj project, src-gen/test/resources/cucumber/specs/Process.feature file will be created as follows

----
@tag2 @tag3
Feature: Process

  Background: Setup

    Given The blah application, something/Object page is created as follows
