= Test-Suite: UML Step Definition To Document

@sheep-dog-dev

TODO there's no test for no parameters and docstring vs datatable. Other tests implicitly cover docstring as a special parameter with the name content

== Test-Setup: Create a test case

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process.asciidoc file is created as follows

----
= Test-Suite: Process

== Test-Case: Submit

* Given: The blah application, Object page is created as follows

----

== Test-Case: No statement, one step parameter

* And: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/blah application/Object page.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
----
= Step-Object: Object page

== Step-Definition: is created as follows

* Step-Parameters: 1
