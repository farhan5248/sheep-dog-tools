@sheep-dog-dev

== Test-Case: One row, one cell

* Given: The code-prj project, src-gen/test/resources/cucumber/specs/Process.feature file is created as follows
+
----
Feature: Process

  Scenario: Submit
    Given The Object page is created as follows
          | h1 |
          | v1 |
----

* When: The maven plugin, cucumber-to-uml goal is executed

* Then: The spec-prj project, uml/pst.uml file will be present

* And: The uml/pst.uml file Interaction Messages section will be created as follows
+
|===
| Interaction Name       | Message                               | Argument Name | Annotation Detail
| specs::Process::Submit | The Object page is created as follows | dataTable     | 0 -} h1 \|       
| specs::Process::Submit | The Object page is created as follows | dataTable     | 1 -} v1 \|
